# Vectors
- Vectors act like resizable arrays

## Declaring a vector
- General Form: Vector<type> v = new Vector();
- type needs to be a valid reference type

## Adding an element to a vector
- v.add(object of type);

# Notes

## United States

# Java Arrays
- An **array** is a collection of variables of the same type

## Declaring an Array
- General Form: type[] arrayName;
- only creates a reference
- no array has actually been created yet

## Creating an Array (Instantiation)
- General form:  arrayName = new type[numberOfElements];
- numberOfElements must be a positive Integer.
- Gotcha: Array size is not modifiable once instantiated.
